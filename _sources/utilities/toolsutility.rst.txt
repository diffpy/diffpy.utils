Tools Utility
#############

The ``diffpy.utils.tools`` module contains tool functions for use with diffpy apps.
One of these functions, ``get_user_info``, is designed for managing and tracking username and email information.
This function helps storing this data in a ``diffpyconfig.json`` file.

Users can use the module to simplify the process of loading, merging, and saving information consistently and easily.
Additionally, it saves the effort of re-entering information, and allows overriding current information by
passing parameters.
