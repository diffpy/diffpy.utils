Parsers Utility
===============

The ``diffpy.utils.parsers`` module allows users to easily and robustly load file data into a Python project.

- ``loadData()``: Find and load a data table/block from a text file. This seems to work for most datafiles
  including those generated by diffpy programs. Running only ``numpy.loadtxt`` will result in errors
  for most these files as there is often excess data or parameters stored above the data block.
  Users can instead choose to load all the parameters of the form ``<param_name> = <param_value>`` into a dictionary
  with this function by setting the ``header`` parameter to ``True``.

  The program identifies data blocks as the first matrix block with a constant number of columns.
  A user can tune the minimum number of rows this matrix block must have.

- ``deserialize_data()``: Load data from a serial file format into a Python dictionary. Currently, the only supported
  serial format is ``.json``.

- ``serialize_data()``: Serialize the data generated by ``loadData()`` into a serial file format. Currently, the only
  supported serial format is ``.json``.
