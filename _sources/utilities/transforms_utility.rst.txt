Transforms Utility
==================

The ``diffpy.utils.transforms`` module provides a set of functions for managing and analyzing diffraction data,
including angle-space transformations between ``q``, ``2theta``, and ``d``-spacing.

These functions allow developers to standardize diffraction data and convert it between different spacings,
simplifying analysis, visualization, and processing.
They are also internally used by the ``DiffractionObject`` class for efficient data manipulation.
