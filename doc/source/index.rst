diffpy.utils - General utilities for analyzing diffraction data

| Software version |release|.
| Last updated |today|.

The diffpy.utils package provides a number of functions and classes designed to help
researchers analyze their diffraction data.  It also includes some functionality for
carrying out PDF analysis.  Examples are parsers for reading common format diffraction
data files, ``DiffractionObjects`` that allow you to do algebra on diffraction patterns,
tools for better capture and propagation of metadata,
diffraction-friendly interpolation routines, as well as some other tools used across
diffpy libraries.
